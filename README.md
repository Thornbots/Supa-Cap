Rose-Hulman's Thornbot's Electrical Team's Super Capacitor Bank

This is an active, work in progress super capacitor bank and super capacitor controller board design that is intended to be used with the DJI Robomaster's competetion. 

User Guide (Currently non-existent, but will be completed eventually) can be found in Documentation
PCB Files can be found in the Design Files folder, with all of the projects being done in KiCAD. 

Use this design at your own risk, as nothing is guranteed to work and/or be safe.
Enjoy, and ask any questions in our Team's Discord. :)
